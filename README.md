### Hi, I'm Derya Kokat ðŸ‘‹

Hi! My name is Derya and I have been interested in programming for a long time. In this quarantine, I had the chance to focus on different programming languages. For example, Python.

I've always been a person that if I didn't know how to make something ðŸ”Ž I'd find out how to do it, so programming has been a perfect fit for me.

ðŸŽ“ I am currently studying industrial engineering. My senior year. I also studied electronics technology before. I started the software by first learning C++. My curiosity increased and I continued to learn HTML, Macro Excel and C#. I've been very interested in data science lately. I attended courses offered by IBM on Coursera and decided to learn Python (Pandas). I'm still in the learning phase, it's already a very comprehensive library. I look forward to working in the field of data science in the future :)

I like watching movies, playing tennis, camping and learning foreign languages.
